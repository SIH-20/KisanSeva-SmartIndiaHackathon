<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Uttarakhand is primarily an agricultural state. The contribution of agriculture to the states domestic product is about 22.4 percent and the population dependent on agriculture for their livelihood is about 75 -85 percent. 

For instance, As per Uttarakhand state planning Commission, 2007, the productivity of wheat in the hills is 13.2 quintals/hectare and rice is 12.36 quintals/hectare. Thus, agricultural opportunities are developing rapidly in the state. Especially, in sector of organic agriculture, Uttarakhand Is highly accessible because of largely rain-fed agriculture and very low use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the produce grown by farmer in the area are not only rich in nutrients but also have high medicinal value and provides an opportunity to develop and farmer friendly environment of organic farming that provide better value in the market to Small and Marginal Land holder. 

The various project of Department of rural development and agriculture are continuously in the process of enhancing farmer and self-help groups (SHGs) livelihoods by adding value in their produce and providing favourable markets. 

We provided a technology-based interventions to farmers for Value addition to agriculture produce, Packaging, Logistic movement, Farmer Branding and marketing avenues. This platform is built to enable direct movement of farmer to the consumer and reduce the intermediates who take away a lion's share of commission.
