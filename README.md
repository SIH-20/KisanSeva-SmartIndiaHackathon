# Rice quality analysis through image processing
We analyse the quality of rice by calculating the average length/breadth ratio for each rice grain. We use **Image processing** Based on this ratio, rice quality can be graded. This implementation is based on this [research paper](https://github.com/hkedia321/rice-quality-analysis/research-paper.pdf). We are using `openCV`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` libraries in `Python 2`.
