#This is our repository for team Codeline. Our team consists of Abhinav, Chirag, Ishan, Kshitij, Pranav and Shivam.

We have implemented 3 things(change branch to see code):
1. Android application (![Documentation](https://github.com/SIH-20/KisanSeva-SmartIndiaHackathon/edit/android/README.md))
2. Web App
   Ecommerce Portal - [buyfreshdtu.xyz](https://buyfreshdtu.xyz/)
   Admin Portal - [admin.buyfreshdtu.xyz](https://admin.buyfreshdtu.xyz/)
3. AI Model

# Rice quality analysis through image processing
We analyse the quality of rice by calculating the average length/breadth ratio for each rice grain. We use **Image processing** Based on this ratio, rice quality can be graded. This implementation is based on this [research paper](https://github.com/hkedia321/rice-quality-analysis/research-paper.pdf). We are using `openCV`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` libraries in `Python 2`.
